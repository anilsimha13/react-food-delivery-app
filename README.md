# React Food Delivery App
React is a _Javascript Library_ developed by _Facebook_

## Day - 1

### Things to remember

- VS code use Emeet (_Intellisense_)
- Browsers has Javascript engine in it
- CDN (_Content Delivery Network_)
- Cross-Origin
  - _refers to an attempt by a web browser to access a resource (like an API or a file) from a different origin than the one the web page was served from_
- React.createElement() is just an Javascript Object
- If you want to create the html elements at same level(Sibilings), you can use it by having Square brackets as [below code](#render-using-react-in-html-traditional-approach)

### Setup React

- CDN Links (_Not a recommended way_)
  - Update just above the closing tag of Body in html

### Code to remember

- Render using Javascript in html (_Traditional Approach_)

```java
    <script>
        const heading = document.createElement("h1");
        heading.innerHTML = "Hello World!üåè";
        const root = document.getElementById("root");
        root.appendChild(heading);
    </script>
```

- Render using React in html (_Traditional Approach_)

```java
  <script>
      const heading = React.createElement(
        "div",
        { id: "parent", attribute: "value" },
        [React.createElement('h1',{},"Hello World!üåè üß†"), 
        React.createElement('h5',{},'Creating the sibiling elements using Square Bracketsü•π[ ]')]
      );
      const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
      root.render(heading);

  </script>
```
- Props (_elements, keys, children,attribures_)
